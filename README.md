# Voice Identification Using Classification Methods

# Goal
To build a model that predicts the audio clips based on their categories as humans and non-humans in four classes namely cat, dog, human female and human male using machine learning algorithms.

# Dataset Description
Have collected the dataset in the form of audio signals. These audio signals are in 
the form of .wav(wave) format. These audio files contains of four classes namely cat, dog, 
female and male. These audio files contains 51 audio clips for each classes therefore totally 
204 files.
